## Bit flipped videos
I've included the USENIX opening sequence video as well as the actual bit flipped videos. Note that the effect we saw in the talk was because of my own video decoder, and it's possible that other devices use different error concealment strategies with different effects e.g., all gray, all black, all YUV 0x00 which looks green, or the fun rainbow effect.
